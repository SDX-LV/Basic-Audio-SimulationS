# BASS FEM validation of Spherical source in free space

Link to the tutorial for this project:

Disclaimer - this is **Not** a Basic acoustic simulation tutorial! - This is a **validation & reference data collection** to establish a baseline of sound propogation without any room effects (boundaries).

The method is **heavily** based and validated against: https://computational-acoustics.gitlab.io/website/posts/8-the-pulsating-sphere/ by Stefano Tronci.
